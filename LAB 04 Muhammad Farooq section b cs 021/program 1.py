#Program 1(a): Practicing with simple if condition. Execute the following program with a = 400 and b = 500. Then change the value of a =500 and b = 400.   
a = 400
b = 500
if a == 400:
    print("The value of a is equal to 400")
    if a < b:
        print("The value of a is less than b")
    if a > b:
        print("The value of a is greater than b")
    if a != b:
        print("The value of a is not equal to b")
    if a <= b:
